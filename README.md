# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Description

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a JS game/application that we are hopefully,All familar with. And if not, No worries! This is a great day to play and learn! This game leverages DOM manipulation to interact with the user. I built this project because I loved playing Rock-paper-scissors as a kid. I wanted to get involved with something exciting that both, adults and kids could enjoy together! I hope you all enjoy!
